# Predicting Next Attacking Action in Football Matches

## Objective
The objective of this project is to produce a model capable of correctly predicting the next attacking action during a football match. The model will take in time sequential in-game information from previous matches as well as the "current" match and attempt to correctly predict the next move of the attacking team.

## Introduction
The data used for this project was gotten from StatsBomb's open data GitHub [repository](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data). The model relied specifically on StatsBomb 360 event data, which contains location of attacking and defending players accross the pitch to further improve the decision making of the model.
